  **Donâ€™t Swim in Data: Real-Time Microbial Forecasting for New Zealand Recreational Waters**
                                                                          

Traditional water quality monitoring, which relies on infrequent sampling and 48-hour lab- oratory delays, fails to capture rapid contamination fluctuations, leaving recreational water users exposed to health risks. To address this critical gap, we developed two novel machine learning frameworks for real-time forecasting of Enterococci concentrations in Canterbury, New Zealand.

The Probabilistic Forecasting Framework employs an ensemble of quantile regression models (covering the 5th to 98th percentiles), a gradient boosting meta-learner, and Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) to produce both accurate point forecasts and calibrated 90% prediction intervals. This approach captures the full range of contamination scenarios, enabling proactive, risk-based water quality management.

The Matrix Decomposition Framework uses Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to separate complex spatio-temporal water quality data into interpretable latent factors, which are then modeled with multi-target Random Forests. This method enhances inter- pretability and generalization, particularly for new monitoring sites with limited historical data.

Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset (2021â€“2024, 15 sites, 1047 samples, 100 exceedance events), the Probabilistic Framework achieved an overall exceedance sensitivity of 67.0% (rising to 75.7% in 2023â€“2024), a precautionary sensitivity of 77.0%, and a specificity of 92.3%, with a WMAPE of 17.2% during exceedance events. The Matrix Decomposition Framework delivered comparable performance, with an exceedance sensitivity of 61.0%, a precaution- ary sensitivity of 74.0%, a specificity of 90.6%, and a WMAPE of 20.3%. Together, these frameworks not only exceed USGS guidelines but also outperform traditional operational methods and standard ML benchmarks (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and multi-layer perceptrons), while displaying highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art systems such as Aucklandâ€™s Safeswim.

SHAP analysis confirmed that short-term rainfall and wind conditions are the primary drivers of contamination, aligning with hydrological principles. A complete forecasting systemâ€”comprising a real-time data pipeline with automated validation and an interactive analytics dashboardâ€”has been deployed in a staging environment, demonstrating both operational feasibility and the potential for broader applications in environmental risk management.

## Overview

Traditional water quality monitoring, characterized by sparse sampling and multi-day lab delays, often overlooks rapid contamination changes, posing risks to recreational water users. To address this gap, this repository implements two novel machine learning frameworks for real-time Enterococci forecasting in Canterbury, New Zealand:

1. **The Probabilistic Forecasting Framework** employs quantile regression (5thâ€“98th percentiles), a gradient boosting meta-learner, and Conformalized Quantile Regression to provide precise single-point forecasts and calibrated 90% prediction intervals.

2. **The Matrix Decomposition Framework** leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization to decompose complex spatio-temporal water quality data into lower-dimensional latent factors, modeled via multi-target Random Forestsâ€”enhancing generalization and addressing cold-start challenges at new coastal sites.

Evaluated on a dataset from 15 locations (2021â€“2024, 1047 samples, 100 exceedance events), our frameworks achieve:
- Exceedance sensitivity up to 67.0% (increasing to 75.7% in 2023â€“2024)
- Precautionary sensitivity up to 77.0%
- Specificity up to 92.3%
- WMAPE as low as 17.2% during exceedance events

Together, these frameworks exceed USGS guidelines, outperform traditional operational methods and standard ML benchmarks, while displaying highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art nowcasting systems such as Auckland's Safeswim.

| **Probabilistic Framework** | 872 | 52.3 | **17.2** | **67.0** | 92.3 |
| **Matrix Decomposition** | **870** | 54.2 | 20.3 | 61.0 | 90.6 |
| Virtual Beach (Baseline) | 934 | 48.2 | 42.4 | 38.0 | 92.9 |
