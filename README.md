\noindent Traditional water quality monitoring, reliant on infrequent sampling and 48-hour laboratory delays, often fails to capture rapid contamination fluctuations, exposing recreational water users to significant health risks. We propose two novel machine learning frameworks for real-time forecasting of Enterococci concentrations in Canterbury, New Zealand. The \textbf{Probabilistic Forecasting Framework} uses an ensemble of quantile regression models with a gradient boosting meta-learner and Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) to produce accurate point forecasts and calibrated 90\% prediction intervals. In parallel, the \textbf{Matrix Decomposition Framework} employs Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to decompose spatio-temporal data into interpretable latent factors, modeled via multi-target Random Forests to enhance generalizability. Evaluated on data from 15 sites (2021–2024, 1047 samples, 100 exceedance events), our frameworks exceed USGS guidelines, achieving exceedance sensitivities of 67.0\% and 61.0\%, with high precautionary sensitivities of 77.0\% and 74.0\%, respectively, and competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art systems such as Auckland’s Safeswim. SHAP analysis confirms that short-term rainfall and wind are key contamination drivers. A real-time forecasting system, complete with an automated data pipeline and interactive dashboard, has been deployed in a staging environment, demonstrating operational feasibility.
